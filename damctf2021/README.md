# [DAMCTF 2021](https://damctf.xyz/)

## 6-8 Nov 2021

This was a pretty enjoyable CTF. Admins and competitors were both friendly, and challenges were reasonably difficult (many challenges I made it through halfway and then gave up). Also, this CTF has inspired me to start making my own cheatsheets for SSTI, SQLi etc for future reference. After compiling them, I'll probably upload them here as well, so do keep an eye out! :)

As usual I didn't attempt any of the pwn challs (ok maybe one but i swear never to touch pwn again)

For this set of writeups and future writeups, I'll be adopting a new, more organized style, with writeups in their respective challenge folders and downloads in the downloads folder.
