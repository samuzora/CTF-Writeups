# malware/sneaky-script (forensics/rev)

Author: captainGeech

We recovered a malicious script from a victim environment. Can you figure out what it did, and if any sensitive information was exfiltrated? We were able to export some PCAP data from their environment as well.

Interesting malware challenge with partial networking element...

It seemed reasonably simple at first: In TCP stream 18 there is a HTTP conversation, probably from the "malware" script. Recognizing that it's in base64 (also can derive that from the malware shell script) I decoded it...

For some reason, when I decoded the script in base64 it came out partially corrupted. 

Since I had hardly any time left I just gave up lol
